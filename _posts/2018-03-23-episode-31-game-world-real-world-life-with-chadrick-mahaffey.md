Chadrick Mahaffey and I introduce you to SFEOS, a project that he originated and is shepherding, that I and others are helping along. 

SFEOS is a lot of things at once:

It's a game that is fun, that engages players in adventure and economics and social organization in the game universe. 

It's a project that is developed, advanced and governed solely by players with real skin in the game, those who contribute value.

It's a distributed autonomous organization/community with an economic system that acts both in the game and outside the game to incentivize and reward all participants.

It's a tool to painlessly drive adoption of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets and integrate them into day-to-day experience.

It's a learning tool and testing ground in the realms of crypto asset, social and political organization, economics, etc.

It's all these and more. 

Mostly it's designed to be FUN!

Want to play?

Listen in and see what's afoot.
