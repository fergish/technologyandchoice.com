It was an absolute pleasure to have a long talk with Adam B. Levine about the concept of Value, its core meaning, how we exchange with each other with Value in mind, and how new tools of cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens give us options that have never existed before--and, of course, some speculation on the possibilities!

There's a lot here, folks. Enjoy!
