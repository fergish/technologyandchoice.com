#### In this Episode

A few days at the Porcupine Freedom Festival in New Hampshire netted a load of wonderful connections, some very interesting insights and a few very relevant interviews, from the perspective of the technology and choice pair.

First up in this episode is Sam Patterson, Chief Operating Officer of OB1, the company developing the Open Bazaar protocol and ecosystem. Sam shares some insights about the ideals of peer-to-peer commerce, shares some very encouraging news about the current real-world successes of the platform, and shares exciting news about the near future, which will make the ecosystem tons better still.

Next we spend some quality time with Larken Rose discussing his very ambitious and fabulously important project, The Mirror. This could be one of the most important projects in existence for opening human potential, so listen up and consider pitching in.

Finally, we speak with Jeremy Kauffman of LBRY (pronounced "library"). With their imminent launch of the LBRY platform, listeners are in a unique position to get in on the ground floor of what I found to be one of the most exciting practical applications of blockchain technology to come along recently. Content distribution is about to get a really great tool that everyone can use, even the "big guys." Listen for how to get an inside track on the launch for listening to this podcast.
