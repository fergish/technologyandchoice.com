Christopher Jackson has been making unique and special events happen for a long time and understands the components. We talk about what he's done, why he changed from being a promoter and producer of hip Hollywood parties attended by the likes of Hugh Hefner and his entourage, and others, to producing a different kind of experience that allows for people to connect on a whole different and more satisfying level.

We also talk about his part in last year's One Love Festival, and how his technical application will be helping transform it even more as it goes forward. Only hints so far about cryptocurrency integration, but that's coming.
