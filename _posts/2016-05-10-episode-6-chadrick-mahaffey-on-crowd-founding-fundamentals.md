#### In this Episode

Chadrick Mahaffey is a software developer and fan of the SAFE Network. For years he's been working to understand organization principles so as to evolve a way that people can "Labor in Freedom."

In this interview, we go into the background of how he arrived at what he now calls The Crowd Found Hub, a system using smart contracts and crypto tokens to allow for a very open and fruitful way to organize group activities in a completely voluntary way, but with a way of rewarding value created by participants.

Could change a lot of the way we think about how we "have to" do things.
