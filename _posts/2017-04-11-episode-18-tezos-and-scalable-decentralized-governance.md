excerpt: "
Those weary of the complexity, inequities and corruption of govern-**ment** tend to also be weary of the idea of govern-**ance**.  But there's no way around it: Governance happens one way or the other, because otherwise **stuff** just **happens**. Not an optimum scene, for sure."

> >**Governance** - the act or activity of looking after and making decisions about something -- Merriam-Webster.com

Those weary of the complexity, inequities and corruption of govern-**ment** tend to also be weary of the idea of govern-**ance**.  But there's no way around it: Governance (by the above definition) happens one way or the other, because otherwise **stuff** just **happens**. Not an optimum scene, for sure.

Arthur Breitman, CTO and lead developer of Tezos,  started thinking about this years ago, and started developing Tezos as a way to account for the inevitable need to adapt the means of decision-making and action within a decentralized cryptocurrency environment. 

In this episode we try to take a simpleton's approach to examining Bitcoin and related currencies in a way most anyone can follow, and then examine the factors that need to be managed in any decentralized cryptocurrency system, and start to examine how Tezos deals with these points.

I say "start," because we could only get so far in one hour. There's more to come, but you don't want to miss this one, for sure.
