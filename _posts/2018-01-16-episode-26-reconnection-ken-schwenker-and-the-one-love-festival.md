Modern technology has enabled us to do so many things that were never possible in history.  People move more, farther and faster than ever in history. The internet has allowed us to communicate and form relationships with others from almost anywhere.  

But the impulse for in-person connection with others, the forming of personal bonds, is strong and too often unfulfilled. 

Festivals of all sorts are exploding in popularity all around the world.  These events take many forms, for many reasons. What they hold in common is that they are gatherings of people of common interest, in person, to celebrate community in their preferred forms.

In this episode, we talk with Ken Schwenker, a motion picture producer who has gone on to produce a series of powerful events and festivals to help meet that need for true community reconnection. We talk about the rational and technology for putting on such a festival, what the six-year-running One Love Festival is about, and drop hints about other technological innovations to be forthcoming surrounding this year's festival.
