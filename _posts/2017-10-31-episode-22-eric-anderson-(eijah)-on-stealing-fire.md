At the recent Texas Bitcoin Conference I had a chance to have a long talk with Eric Anderson (hacker-named "Eijah") about his new project, Promether.

We cover his history, including a good delve into Demonsaw (a very effective, proven means of anonymous, secure and private communication and file sharing) which has been in use for the last four years.

With the experience gained on securing privacy with Demonsaw, Eric is launching a much more ambitious project to deliver privacy and anonymity to the mainstream, making it easy and rewarding to do so.

Along for the ride  in the interview, with his own questions and perspectives on privacy, is Ernest Hancock of FreedomsPhoenix.com, and the Declare Your Independence radio show.
