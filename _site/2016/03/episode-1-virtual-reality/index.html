<h4 id="in-this-episode">In this Episode</h4>

<p>Welcome to the first episode of Technology and Choice, the podcast where we’re likely to talk about almost anything, as long as it centers around these two concepts.</p>

<p>In this episode, we introduce ourselves (John and Robert) and lay the groundwork for the ongoing podcast. Then we take up the subject of Virtual Reality technology, how it’s starting to take its place in the world, as well as what choices it makes possible, and necessary.</p>
