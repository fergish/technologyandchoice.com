#### In this Episode

Recently caught up to Jeremy Kauffman, Founder and CEO of LBRY, a protocol and platform for sharing digital content, with incentives for all.

The first part of the show is a replay of an earlier interview form July 2016, because it's hard to improve on for a clear idea of how LBRY is supposed to work. 

The last part is the recent interview, where we catch up on how things are going, some of the bumps in the road since July, and projections for the future.
