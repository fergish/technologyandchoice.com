What is the most basic action in the universe? Influence.

Technology is all about better directing influence, whether it be influence on the environment, the materials at hand, electronics, software, or people. And there is a lot of technology on the nature of influence and persuasion amongst people. 

In this episode, we look at how influence is the most fundamental action of life, and why it's a good idea to not be ignorant of the technologies of personal and social influence. After all, who really wants to be a dupe? Answer? Those who remain ignorant of the nature and mechanics of personal influence.
